Cards.app is used for keeping track of players' scores while playing card games. It is a node.js app that uses mongodb for persistence of users and scores.

Future tasks:

	- implement users and game names
	
	- rearrange players by drag and drop -- see http://jsfiddle.net/rniemeyer/hw9B2/
	
	- improve visualization/analysis of scores over time by player and game
	
	- utilize sails.js or a similar mvc module to keep the cards.app codebase as easily manageable as possible
	
	- find a decent site icon
